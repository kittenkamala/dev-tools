This repo contains some developer tools for debugging poor performance in an application.

â€¢ env-vars.sh 
    Contains environment variables with blank values that need to be filled in as applicable to the target environment. The file has been added to .gitignore for security purposes, and the repo can be pushed to without exposing those sensative authentication details. 
    The file should be modified on your local.
